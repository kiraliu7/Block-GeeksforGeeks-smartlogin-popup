# Script Practice: Close-GeeksforGeeks-smartlogin-popup
Recently when I access geeksforgeeks on my pc with chrome, there is a bug which wont let me close the login prompt which automatically pops up, and locked the scroll bar. To still access the content, I have to manully delete the login element, change overflow to auto, and remove listeners that bring me back to top of the page whenever I which to scroll down. 
Thus, I decided to take this opprtunity and learn to write a script that help do these things so I can browse the site uninterrupted.
